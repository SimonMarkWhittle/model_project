# Model Project Test
This codebase is a test package with which I am practicing modern Python configuration management, optional dependencies management, and editable local package installation.

It is set up as a mock simulation model that provides a simple interface for retrieving some arbitrary data. It is intended to plug into the mock simulation framework found in [this repository](https://github.com/SimonMarkWhittle/simulator_project).
